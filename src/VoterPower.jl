"""
    Run the Single Transferable Vote (STV) algorithm on an election.

    The STV algorithm is a ranked-choice voting system that is used in multi-winner elections.
    It is a generalization of Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) to multi-winner elections.

    The algorithm works as follows:
    1. Each voter ranks the candidates in order of preference.
    2. The votes are tallied. If a candidate has more votes than the (Droop) quota, they are elected (in descending order of votes).
    3. If a candidate has more votes than the quota, the votes are reweighted so that they sum to the surplus, and transferred to the next preference on each ballot.
    4. If no candidate has more votes than the quota, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are transferred to the next preference on each ballot.
    5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all winners have been elected.

    Args:
        election: An Election object representing the election.
        n_winners: The number of winners to elect.
        surviving_candidates: A boolean vector indicating which candidates are still in the running. Indices run from 1 to n_candidates.
            Anti-candidates are after the candidates, in the same order. deindexify can be used to convert from candidate index to candidate id.
        winners: A vector of the candidates who have been elected so far.
        winners_so_far: The number of winners who have been elected so far.
        round: The current round of the election.
        ballot_piles: A matrix to hold the current ballot piles. Each row is a candidate, and 
            each column up to ballot_pile_sizes[row] is a (unique) ballot.
        ballot_pile_sizes: A vector indicating the sizes of the ballot_piles.
        weighted_tallies: A vector of the weighted tallies for each candidate.
        ballot_weights: A vector of the weights of each ballot.

        assert_invariants: A boolean indicating whether to assert invariants at the end of each round. Invariants include:
            - The round should be less than the number of candidates. This should be asserted at 
                the beginning of the function, and regardless of the value of assert_invariants.

            - The sum of the weighted tallies should equal the sum of the ballot weights (up to rounding).
            - The sum of the weighted tallies of the surviving candidates should equal (up to rounding) the Droop(ish) quota times 
                the number of winners remaining plus one.
            - The ballot_piles should be non-zero up to the ballot_pile_sizes, and zero thereafter.
            - The winners should be unique and non-zero up to the number of winners so far, and zero thereafter.
            - The ballot_weights should be in the range [0, 1].
            - winners_so_far should be less than or equal to min(n_winners, round).
            - the sum of ballot_pile_sizes for the surviving candidates should equal the number of ballots.
            - weighted_tallies[row] <= ballot_pile_sizes[row] for all surviving candidates.
            - (We could also check that weighted_tallies equal the sum of the appropriate ballot_weights, but that's too slow.)

    #OK, let's think a bit about possible additional outputs.
    #These should be via optional mutable arguments, of course. Testing to see if arg is nothing is cheap.
    #1. Empirical ("white-box") power matrix. This is a matrix of the power of each voter to elect each winner.
    #   Dimensions: n_winners x n_voters. This is a measure of the power of each voter to elect each winner.
    
    #2. Distance from pivotality. The smallest margin by which any branch was taken. Flipping fewer than half this
    #  number of voters could not have changed the outcome. This is a measure of the robustness of the outcome, useful
    #  for speeding up binary search. (This is the simplest output that avoids at least some re-runs as we flip voters.

# Functions for creating electorates of spatial voters 

# Three possible ways to create a spatial electorate:
# 1. Gaussian model of voters and candidates
# 2. Dirichlet mixture model of (Gaussian clusters of) voters and candidates
# 3. Hierarchical Dirichlet mixture model of voters and candidates. 
#     That is to say, a tree, where each branch is a DMM and each leaf is a GM.

# Option 1 is probably too simple, as it makes systemic Condorcet cycles impossible.
# Option 3 is probably overkill â€” not in terms of the electorates it produces, but just 
# in terms of the complexity to code the model. Basically, you'd need separate propagation and cutoff rules
# for alpha, precision (inverse variance of GMMs), and dimension weights â€” and all of those would have parameters
# that would need to be tuned (either a priori or empirically).

# So let's code options 1 (as a simple example, and as a building block) and 2 (as a more realistic model).
# That means that even though 2 could be seen as a special case of 3, we'll make types for 2 separately, 
# then maybe do 3 later without worrying about the code/type duplication.

# Still, even for option 2 (DMM), we'll need to decide how to propagate precision and weights. Sub-options:
# A. Just use the same precision and weights for all subclusters. This is the simplest, but not realistic.
#    In real life, different voter groups care about different issues differently.
# B. Propagate precision and weights from the parent cluster to the subclusters, but allow them to change.
#    But how? Let's see...:
#    * Precision and weight on a given dimension are correlated. A group that cares a lot about a dimension
#      (high weight) will also vary less on that dimension (high precision).
#    * This will also correlate with squared deviance on that dimension. (Or is it better to use absolute deviance?)
#    * But maybe we want a ceiling on the weight * deviance product, because otherwise we'll get groups that
#      both extreme and picky, making our a priori dimension weights (and thus, the calculation of the effective
#      number of dimensions of the electorate as a whole, and the dimension weight cutoffs) mean something quite 
#      different from their naive interpretation.
#    * I think the lesson here is that, assuming we're propagating using chi squared distributions, we should
#      make sure the degrees of freedom aren't too low.
# ...OK, so "simple" version of B is:
# For a new cluster, draw standard normals A, B, C, D for each dimension. Position is A, precision (factor) is
# sqrt(AÂ²+BÂ²+CÂ²/3), and weight factor is sqrt(AÂ²+BÂ²+DÂ²/3). (Thus, precision and weight are both from "chi" distributions with 3 df.)

# Let's code that up. If we want to vary df, we can refactor later.

# Functions for getting voter power (in the sense of black-box or mirror-universe power). For now let's call this BBVP.

# BBVP is defined as the probability that a voter is pivotal for a given candidate, under the "mirror universe distribution"
# of elections, minus the probability that they're anti-pivotal, times the number of voters. By construction, the sum of BBVPs
# for a given candidate is 1. (This is because basic assumptions about the voting system imply that a winner of the actual
# election will not win a fully-mirrored election; thus, for any permutation, the number of pivotal voters minus the number of
# anti-pivotal voters is 1.)

# To generate the mirror universe distribution,
# 1. Take the actual election as it occurred.
# 2. Take a random permutation of the voters.
# 3. Take a uniformly random fraction of the voters and mirror up to that fraction in order of the permutation.

# A voter is pivotal under this distribution if they are the next voter to be mirrored, AND if mirroring them would cause
# the given candidate not to win. (If the candidate is already not winning, the voter is not pivotal.)
# Anti-pivotality is defined similarly, but causing them to win.

# (OK this definition is problematic because the draw from the mirror universe distribution yields not just an election, but
# also a "next voter" to check. Pretty sure it's possible to rewrite this to something clean and equivalent but that's not
# the point right now.)

# Estimating a given voter's BBVP by naive brute-force sampling is infeasible (it's O((V+1)!), where V is the number of 
# voters) so we need to take advantage of
# symmetries. In particular, when we use a specific permutation to find a pivotal voter, we can find all voters who are
# equivalent to that voter in terms of pivotality; that is, who would be pivotal under a permutation that swaps them with
# the pivotal voter. This will generally be approximately V/C voters, where C is the number of candidates. This speeds things
# up by a factor of (almost) V/C because we're effectively finding pivotality for V/C different permutations at once.

# (Actually, "equivalency" here could be defined in two ways: either the simple definition above, or "weighted equivalency",
# where we look for voters who are "pulling in the same direction", then weight by "how far they're pulling". These are
# asymptotically the same; "weighted equivalency" is a bit more efficient, but "simple equivalency" is slightly more correct 
# in small samples.)

# Still, we're never going to exhaustively search all permutations, so any measure of BBVP will be an estimate (with an estimated
# error). We can reduce the error by taking more samples, but that's about it.

# So the key functions will be:
# sample_a_pivotal_voter_for: find *a* pivotal voter for one random permutation. Note that this uses binary search, so it's
#      essentially assuming that there's no anti-pivotal voters (thus, only one pivotal voter). 
#      This assumption should almost entirely hold for STV. Insofar as it doesn't,
#      this will bias things slightly in a way I haven't worked out yet.
# find_equivalent_voters: find all voters who are equivalent to a given voter in terms of pivotality.
#      (takes a flag for "weighted equivalency" or not)
# sample_one_BBVP: use the two above to calculate the BBVP contribution for that one permutation and equivalents.
#      (takes a flag for "weighted equivalency" or not)
# estimate_BBVP: get estimated_BBVP (and its error) for all voters for a given candidate, by looping over sample_one_BBVP and averaging.
# estimate_all_BBVPs: get estimate_BBVPs for all winning candidates (in a matrix)
